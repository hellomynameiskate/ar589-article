<p>My solo hike on the Pacific Crest Trail—three months, 1,100 miles—had many beginnings. There was the first, flip decision to do it, followed by the second, more serious decision to actually do it, and then the weeks of shopping and packing and preparing to do it. There was the quitting of my job as a waitress and finalizing my divorce from a man I still loved and selling almost everything I owned and visiting my mother’s grave one last time. There was the driving across the country from Minneapolis to Portland, Oregon, and, a few days later, catching a flight to Los Angeles and a ride to the town of Mojave.</p>
<p>At which point, at long last, there was the actual doing it, quickly followed by the grim realization of what it meant to do it, followed by the decision to quit doing it because doing it was absurd and ridiculously difficult and I was profoundly unprepared to do it.</p>
<p>And then there was the real live truly doing it.</p>
<p>Before I began my hike, I’d thought myself somewhat ready. I was someone who could be described as outdoorsy. My family vacations had always involved some form of camping. As an adult, I’d slept in the back of my truck in national forests more times than I could count. Plus, I’d spent my teen years in the Minnesota northwoods in a house my mother and stepfather built that didn’t have an indoor toilet, electricity, or running water. My mother planted a garden and pickled vegetables, baked bread and carded wool, and made half the clothes my siblings and I wore.</p>
<p>My mother and I were college seniors when we learned she had cancer. She’d begun college when I did, pursuing a dream after years of setting it aside. Her college was in Duluth, mine in Minneapolis. We’d always been close—her love for me and my sister and my brother was all-encompassing and full-throttle—but in my college years we became even closer, talking almost every night on the phone. I was married by then, to a man named Paul I’d wed in our woods, wearing a white satin-and-lace dress my mother had sewn.</p>
<p>Until she was dying, it hadn’t occurred to me that my mother would die. She was monolithic and insurmountable, the keeper of my life. She would grow old and more beautiful and still work in the garden. This image was fixed in my mind. And yet the doctors all said the same thing: There was no cure. She was 45.</p>
<p>I folded my life down. I told Paul not to count on me. I wanted to quit school, but my mother insisted that I still get my degree. She herself needed to complete only a couple more classes to graduate; she would get her B.A. if it killed her, she said, and we laughed and then looked at each other darkly.</p>
<p>I cut my classes down to two days a week and afterward drove the three hours north to be with my mother. On good days she sat in a chair and talked to me. There was nothing much to say. She’d been so transparent and effusive and I so inquisitive all my life that we’d already covered everything. I knew the names of the horses she had loved as a girl: Pal and Buddy and Bacchus. I knew she’d lost her virginity at seventeen with a boy named Mike. I knew how she met my father the next year and what he seemed like to her on their first few dates. How, when she’d broken the news of her unwed teen pregnancy to her parents, her father had dropped a spoon. All growing up I’d asked and asked, making her describe those scenes, wanting to know who said what and how, what she’d felt inside while it was going on. And she’d told me, laughing and asking why on earth I wanted to know. I wanted to know. I couldn’t explain. But now that she was dying, I knew everything. My mother was in me already. Not just the parts of her that I knew, but the parts of her that had come before me, too.</p>
<p>I was wrong about it being impossible for my mother to die: She lived only 49 days after learning she had cancer.</p>
<p>Three and a half years later, I was at an outdoor store in Minneapolis. It was December 1994. On a shelf I saw a book called The Pacific Crest Trail: Volume 1: California. I picked it up. The PCT, I learned, was a continuous wilderness trail, 2,650 miles long, that traversed the entire length of California, Oregon, and Washington, passing through national parks and forests; through deserts and mountains; across rivers and highways. I turned the book over and gazed at its front cover—a boulder-strewn lake surrounded by rocky crags against a blue sky—then placed it back on the shelf and left.</p>
<p>But later I returned and bought the book. I couldn’t explain it. Something bloomed inside me as I traced the jagged line of the trail with my finger.</p>
<p>I pulled into the town of Mojave, California, as the June sun dipped into the Tehachapi Mountains a dozen miles behind me to the west—mountains I’d be hiking the next day. “You can stop here,” I said to the brother of a friend, who’d given me a ride from L.A., gesturing to an old-style neon sign that said “White’s Motel.” By the worn look of the building, I guessed it was the cheapest place in town.</p>
<p>“You sure you’re OK?” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I replied with false confidence and then watched him drive away. I’d spent the past six months imagining this moment, but now that it was here, I felt less exuberant than I had thought I would.</p>
<p>After checking in, I went to my room and sat on the soft bed. I was dressed in the clothes I’d been wearing since I’d left Portland the night before, every last thing brand-new. Wool socks, leather hiking boots, navy-blue shorts, underwear made of a special quick-dry fabric, and a white T-shirt over a sports bra. I felt like a fraud. I’d spent the previous months diligently preparing for my trip—addressing boxes of dehydrated food and camping supplies that a friend would mail to me throughout the summer to places along the PCT with evocative names like Echo Lake and Soda Springs.</p>

    <div class="item3"><p><h3 class="f4 f3-m f2-l gold bodoni i lh-solid fw1 tc">"It occurred to me just then that I’d never actually walked into the wilderness with a backpack on and spent the night. Not even once. I’ve never gone backpacking! I thought with rueful hilarity."</p></div>
    <div class="item4"><p>But now I didn’t have any of the certainty I’d had when I’d sealed those boxes neatly shut with tape. It occurred to me just then that I’d never actually walked into the wilderness with a backpack on and spent the night. Not even once. I’ve never gone backpacking! I thought with rueful hilarity.</p>
      <p>I walked over to my backpack, which was forest green and trimmed with black, and touched its top as if I were caressing a child’s head. I opened one of its compartments and pulled out an orange whistle, whose packaging proclaimed it to be “the world’s loudest.” I ripped it open and held the whistle up by its yellow lanyard, then put it around my neck. Was I supposed to hike wearing it like this? Like so much else, I hadn’t thought it all the way through.</p>
<p>The next morning, after the last shower I’d have for days, I piled all my belongings on the bed. I worked my way through the mountain of things—the thick fleece anorak, the camp chair, the snakebite kit, the tiny collapsible stove—wedging and cramming them into every available space of my pack. I wrapped bungee cords around all the things that didn’t fit. When I was done, I sat on the floor, sweaty from my exertions, and then I remembered one last thing: water.</p>
<p>I guessed it would take me two days to reach the first water source—seventeen miles into my hike—and I would have to carry enough to get me through. I filled two 32-ounce bottles in the bathroom sink and put them in my pack’s mesh side pockets. I dug out my Dromedary and filled up all 2.6 gallons of it. I don’t know how much my pack weighed on that first day, but I do know the water alone was almost 26 pounds.</p>
<p>Finally, when everything I was going to carry was in place, a hush came over me. I was ready. I put on my watch, looped my sunglasses around my neck by their pink neoprene holder, donned my sun hat, and looked at my pack. It was at once enormous and compact, mildly adorable and intimidatingly self-contained. It had an animate quality; in its company, I didn’t feel entirely alone. Standing, it came up to my waist.</p>
<p>I gripped it and bent to lift it.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>I squatted and grasped its frame more robustly and tried to lift it again. Again it did not move. It was exactly like attempting to lift a Volkswagen Beetle. It looked so cute, so ready to be lifted—and yet it was impossible to do.</p>
<p>I sat down beside it and pondered my situation. How could I carry a backpack more than 1,000 miles over rugged mountains and waterless deserts if I couldn’t even budge it an inch in an air-conditioned motel room? It was true that the salespeople at REI had mentioned weight rather often in their soliloquies, but I hadn’t paid much attention.</p>
<p>It was now or never. I sat down right in front of the pack, wove my arms through the shoulder straps, and clipped a strap across my chest. I took a deep breath and began rocking back and forth until I finally hurled myself forward onto my hands and knees. My backpack still seemed like a Volkswagen Beetle, only now it seemed like a Volkswagen Beetle that was parked on my back. The frame of the pack squeaked as I rose, it too straining from the tremendous weight.</p>

    <div class="item5"><h3 class="f4 f3-m f2-l gold bodoni i lh-solid fw1 tc">"I staggered and swayed around the room, my center of gravity pulled in any direction I so much as leaned. It felt pretty awful, and yet perhaps this was how it felt to be a backpacker. I didn’t know."</div>
    <div class="item6">
    <p>I staggered and swayed around the room, my center of gravity pulled in any direction I so much as leaned. It felt pretty awful, and yet perhaps this was how it felt to be a backpacker. I didn’t know.</p>
<p>I made my way to the nearby gas station. Unless I wanted to walk twelve miles along the broiling shoulder of the highway to reach the trail, I needed a ride. Horrible things happened to hitchhikers, I knew, especially to women hitchhiking alone. But hitchhiking was simply what PCT hikers did on occasion. And I was a PCT hiker, right? Right?</p>
<p>I bought a can of Coke and drank it with a casual air that belied the fact that I could not stand up properly. A minivan pulled up and two men, clearly a father and son, got out. I asked for a ride. “Sure,” the older one said finally, with obvious reluctance.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I trilled girlishly.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, I was standing by the silent highway. Small clouds of dust blew in swirling gusts beneath the glaring noon sun. Surrounded in all directions by beige, barren-looking mountains, I was at the southern foot of the Sierra Nevada, which stretched north for more than 400 miles. On a fence post beyond the ditch I spied a palm-size metal blaze that said PACIFIC CREST TRAIL. I was here.</p>
<p>I cinched my pack and took the first steps down the trail to a brown metal box tacked to another fence post. Inside was the trail register. I wrote my name and the date and read the notes from previous hikers, most of them men traveling in pairs, not one of them a woman alone.</p>
<p>The trail headed east, paralleling the highway for a while, dipping down into rocky washes and back up again. I’m hiking! I thought. And then, I am hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail! What is hiking but walking, after all? I can walk! I’d argued when Paul had expressed his concern about my never actually having gone backpacking. But after about fifteen minutes, it was clear that I had never walked into desert mountains with a pack that weighed significantly more than half of what I did strapped onto my back. Which, it turns out, resembles walking less than it does hell.</p>
<p>I began panting and sweating immediately, dust caking my boots and calves as the trail turned north and began to climb. Each step was a toil as I ascended higher and higher still, interrupted only by the occasional short descent, which was a new kind of hell because I had to brace myself against each step, lest gravity’s pull cause me to catapult forward. Soon the voice inside my head was screaming, What have I gotten myself into? I tried to ignore it, to hum as I hiked, though humming proved too difficult to do while also panting. The only possible distraction was my vigilant search for rattlesnakes. The landscape was made for them, it seemed. And also for mountain lions and wilderness-savvy serial killers.</p>
<p>Three hours in, I came to a rare level spot near a gathering of Joshua trees. To my monumental relief, there was a large boulder upon which I could sit and remove my pack. Amazed to be free of its weight, I strolled around and accidentally brushed up against one of the trees and was bayoneted by its sharp spikes. Blood instantly spurted out of three stab wounds on my arm. The wind blew so fiercely that when I removed my first-aid kit from my pack and opened it up, all of my Band-Aids blew away. I chased them uselessly across the flat plain and then they were gone, down the mountain and out of reach.</p>
<p>I’d never been so exhausted in all of my life. I retrieved my guidebook and held the fluttering pages against the wind, hoping that the familiar words and maps would dispel my growing unease. But paging through it for the first time while actually sitting on the trail was less reassuring than I’d hoped. There were things I’d overlooked, I saw now, such as a quote on page six by a fellow named Jim Podlesney that said, “How can a book describe the psychological factors a person must prepare for . . . the despair, the alienation, the anxiety and especially the pain, both physical and mental, which slices to the very heart of the hiker’s volition, which are the real things that must be planned for? No words can transmit those factors. . . .”</p>
<p>I sat pie-eyed, with a lurching knowledge that indeed no words could transmit those factors. I wrapped my arms around my legs and pressed my face into the tops of my bare knees. When I opened my eyes several minutes later, I saw that I was sitting next to a plant I recognized. This sage was less verdant than the sage my mother had grown in our yard for years, but its shape and scent were the same. I reached over and picked a handful of the leaves and rubbed them between my palms, then put my face in them and inhaled deeply, the way my mother had taught me to do. It gives you a burst of energy, she’d always declared on those long days when we’d been working to build our house and our spirits had flagged.</p>

    <div class="item7"><p>"Inhaling it now, I didn’t so much smell the sharp, earthy scent of the desert sage as I did the potent memory of my mother. I looked up at the blue sky, feeling my mother’s presence, remembering why it was that I’d thought I could hike this trail."</p></div>
