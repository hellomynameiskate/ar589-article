<p>My solo hike on the Pacific Crest Trail—three months, 1,100 miles—had many beginnings. There was the first, flip decision to do it, followed by the second, more serious decision to actually do it, and then the weeks of shopping and packing and preparing to do it. There was the quitting of my job as a waitress and finalizing my divorce from a man I still loved and selling almost everything I owned and visiting my mother’s grave one last time. There was the driving across the country from Minneapolis to Portland, Oregon, and, a few days later, catching a flight to Los Angeles and a ride to the town of Mojave.</p>
<p>At which point, at long last, there was the actual doing it, quickly followed by the grim realization of what it meant to do it, followed by the decision to quit doing it because doing it was absurd and ridiculously difficult and I was profoundly unprepared to do it.</p>
<p>And then there was the real live truly doing it.</p>
<p>Before I began my hike, I’d thought myself somewhat ready. I was someone who could be described as outdoorsy. My family vacations had always involved some form of camping. As an adult, I’d slept in the back of my truck in national forests more times than I could count. Plus, I’d spent my teen years in the Minnesota northwoods in a house my mother and stepfather built that didn’t have an indoor toilet, electricity, or running water. My mother planted a garden and pickled vegetables, baked bread and carded wool, and made half the clothes my siblings and I wore.</p>
<p>My mother and I were college seniors when we learned she had cancer. She’d begun college when I did, pursuing a dream after years of setting it aside. Her college was in Duluth, mine in Minneapolis. We’d always been close—her love for me and my sister and my brother was all-encompassing and full-throttle—but in my college years we became even closer, talking almost every night on the phone. I was married by then, to a man named Paul I’d wed in our woods, wearing a white satin-and-lace dress my mother had sewn.</p>
<p>Until she was dying, it hadn’t occurred to me that my mother would die. She was monolithic and insurmountable, the keeper of my life. She would grow old and more beautiful and still work in the garden. This image was fixed in my mind. And yet the doctors all said the same thing: There was no cure. She was 45.</p>
<p>I folded my life down. I told Paul not to count on me. I wanted to quit school, but my mother insisted that I still get my degree. She herself needed to complete only a couple more classes to graduate; she would get her B.A. if it killed her, she said, and we laughed and then looked at each other darkly.</p>
<p>I cut my classes down to two days a week and afterward drove the three hours north to be with my mother. On good days she sat in a chair and talked to me. There was nothing much to say. She’d been so transparent and effusive and I so inquisitive all my life that we’d already covered everything. I knew the names of the horses she had loved as a girl: Pal and Buddy and Bacchus. I knew she’d lost her virginity at seventeen with a boy named Mike. I knew how she met my father the next year and what he seemed like to her on their first few dates. How, when she’d broken the news of her unwed teen pregnancy to her parents, her father had dropped a spoon. All growing up I’d asked and asked, making her describe those scenes, wanting to know who said what and how, what she’d felt inside while it was going on. And she’d told me, laughing and asking why on earth I wanted to know. I wanted to know. I couldn’t explain. But now that she was dying, I knew everything. My mother was in me already. Not just the parts of her that I knew, but the parts of her that had come before me, too.</p>
<p>I was wrong about it being impossible for my mother to die: She lived only 49 days after learning she had cancer.</p>
<p>Three and a half years later, I was at an outdoor store in Minneapolis. It was December 1994. On a shelf I saw a book called The Pacific Crest Trail: Volume 1: California. I picked it up. The PCT, I learned, was a continuous wilderness trail, 2,650 miles long, that traversed the entire length of California, Oregon, and Washington, passing through national parks and forests; through deserts and mountains; across rivers and highways. I turned the book over and gazed at its front cover—a boulder-strewn lake surrounded by rocky crags against a blue sky—then placed it back on the shelf and left.</p>
<p>But later I returned and bought the book. I couldn’t explain it. Something bloomed inside me as I traced the jagged line of the trail with my finger.</p>
<p>I pulled into the town of Mojave, California, as the June sun dipped into the Tehachapi Mountains a dozen miles behind me to the west—mountains I’d be hiking the next day. “You can stop here,” I said to the brother of a friend, who’d given me a ride from L.A., gesturing to an old-style neon sign that said “White’s Motel.” By the worn look of the building, I guessed it was the cheapest place in town.</p>
<p>“You sure you’re OK?” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I replied with false confidence and then watched him drive away. I’d spent the past six months imagining this moment, but now that it was here, I felt less exuberant than I had thought I would.</p>
<p>After checking in, I went to my room and sat on the soft bed. I was dressed in the clothes I’d been wearing since I’d left Portland the night before, every last thing brand-new. Wool socks, leather hiking boots, navy-blue shorts, underwear made of a special quick-dry fabric, and a white T-shirt over a sports bra. I felt like a fraud. I’d spent the previous months diligently preparing for my trip—addressing boxes of dehydrated food and camping supplies that a friend would mail to me throughout the summer to places along the PCT with evocative names like Echo Lake and Soda Springs.</p>

    <div class="item"><p>But now I didn’t have any of the certainty I’d had when I’d sealed those boxes neatly shut with tape. It occurred to me just then that I’d never actually walked into the wilderness with a backpack on and spent the night. Not even once. I’ve never gone backpacking! I thought with rueful hilarity.</p>
